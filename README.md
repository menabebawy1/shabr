# SHABR: Bootstrap Practice
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using Bootstrap components._

## Context
* Your college roommate is not only a hot air balloon enthusiast, but they just got their pilot's license and is ready to start a business!  
* Of course, your roommate needs a website built, so obviously, they turn to you! Your roommate has agreed to give you 10% of the profits during the first 2 years of business! It is in your best interest to make this website look as good as possible!
* Your roommate has given you the content, so all you have to do is put your Bootstrap skills to the test!

## Example
* An example can be found in the `example` sub-directory.
* Your page should be **unique**, so you should **NOT** be copying/paste any of that code.

## Content
* All of the raw content can be found in `raw.txt`. As the designer, feel free to use your judment about the order and other minor changes, but try not to change too much of the content.
* All of the pictures can be found in the `img` sub-directory. As a reminder, reference them using `img/balloon-#.jpg`.
  * Using the balloon clipart is completely **optional**.
* Put your content in `index.html`
* Put your style in `custom.css`
* If you want a navigation bar that includes custom colors, use `nav.css`
* You probably won't need to use `script.js`, but it's there if you do need it.

## Plan
* The best results are always backed by thorough planning.  Before jumping into the Directions below, plan out a reasonable layout for the content.

## Directions
* Working in pairs, have one person **fork** this repository.  That person should add the other person as a **collaborator**.

* Edit, add, commit, push, pull, and resolve merge conflicts as necessary.
* When you are finished, the owner should make **gh-pages** use the **master** branch to make the result live for the world to see.  Make sure you test out the github.io URL!
